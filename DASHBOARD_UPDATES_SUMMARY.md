## Next Steps

1. Run the application to trigger automatic role updates
2. Test dashboard functionality with real data
3. Verify user details view shows team and role information
4. Monitor system metrics for accuracy
5. Consider adding more real-time system monitoring for CPU, memory, etc.

## Notes

- System metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk) are currently placeholder values
- For production, implement actual system monitoring
- Consider adding user activity logging for better audit trails
- Team assignments may need manual configuration for new users
