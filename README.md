## üë• Team Collaboration & Git Workflow

This project is developed by a team of four:
- **Paris**
- **Zilungile**
- **Thando**
- **Dumisani**

### üóÇÔ∏è Branching & Folder Structure
- Each main folder (Controllers, Models, Views, Data, Migrations, wwwroot, etc.) will have its own feature branch for initial implementation and review.
- Branches must follow the [coding standards](OmintakProduction/wwwroot/coding_standards/coding_standards.md) in `wwwroot/coding_standards/`.
- All code, commit messages, and PRs must adhere to these standards.

### üîÑ Merge Plan
- All branches must be merged into `main` within 1 hour of project start.
- Each team member is responsible for a specific area (see below).
- Each commit should be atomic, descriptive, and reference the feature or fix (see commit message guidelines below).

### üë§ Team Member Responsibilities

| Member    | Area(s) of Responsibility                | Example Branch Name           |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Paris     | Models, Data, Migrations                 | feature/models-and-data       |
| Zilungile | Controllers, API, Business Logic         | feature/controllers-api       |
| Thando    | Views, UI/UX, Razor Pages                | feature/views-ui              |
| Dumisani  | wwwroot (CSS/JS/assets), Docs, Testing   | feature/wwwroot-and-docs      |

- **Paris**: Implements all models, seeds, and migrations. Ensures DB structure and relationships are correct.
- **Zilungile**: Implements all controllers (MVC + API), business logic, and validation. Ensures all endpoints are testable.
- **Thando**: Implements all Razor views, partials, and UI/UX. Ensures accessibility and theme consistency.
- **Dumisani**: Implements all static assets (CSS, JS, images), coding standards, and documentation. Ensures code style and testing.

### üìù Commit Message Guidelines
- Use the following prefixes: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/` (see [coding standards](OmintakProduction/wwwroot/coding_standards/coding_standards.md)).
- Example commit messages:
  - `feature/add-task-model`
  - `feature/implement-task-controller`
  - `feature/create-task-views`
  - `feature/add-kanban-css`
  - `bugfix/fix-task-assignment-validation`
  - `docs/update-readme`
  - `refactor/cleanup-dashboard`
- Keep messages concise and relevant to the change.

### üîó Coding Standards Reference
- See [`wwwroot/coding_standards/coding_standards.md`](OmintakProduction/wwwroot/coding_standards/coding_standards.md) for naming, formatting, and branch/commit rules.
- All code must use PascalCase for classes/methods, camelCase for variables, and ALL_CAPS for constants.
- Branches must be lowercase, hyphenated, and descriptive.

### üö¶ Merge Checklist
- [ ] All code reviewed and tested by at least one other team member
- [ ] All branches merged into `main` before the deadline
- [ ] No unresolved merge conflicts
