# Soft Delete Implementation and User Management

## Summary of Changes

### ‚úÖ **Soft Delete Implementation**

#### 1. **User Model Updated**
- Added `IsDeleted` (bool) - soft delete flag
- Added `DeletedAt` (DateTime?) - timestamp when deleted
- Added `DeletedByUserId` (int?) - audit trail of who deleted the user

#### 2. **Database Migration**
- Created migration `AddSoftDeleteToUser` for the new soft delete fields
- All existing users will have `IsDeleted = false` by default

#### 3. **Controller Updates**

**UserController:**
- **DeleteConfirmed()**: Now implements soft delete instead of hard delete
- **SoftDelete()**: New AJAX endpoint for soft delete operations
- **Index()**: Filters out soft-deleted users (`!u.IsDeleted`)
- **GetAllUsers()**: Filters out soft-deleted users
- Added audit trail - tracks which admin deleted the user

**DashboardController:**
- **GetSystemAdminDashboardData()**: Filters out soft-deleted users from dashboard

#### 4. **User Interface Updates**

**SystemAdminDashboard:**
- Added "Delete User" option in user dropdown menu
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- AJAX-powered deletion with success/error messages
- Visual feedback and page refresh after deletion

### ‚úÖ **User Database Implementation**

#### 1. **Removed Seeder Files**
Deleted all seeder files:
- `UserSeeder.cs`
- `UserSeeder2.cs` 
- `UserSeederFixed.cs`
- `RoleUpdateSeeder.cs`

#### 2. **Direct Database Implementation**
Updated `AppDbContext.cs` with hardcoded users:

**Roles Added:**
- SystemAdmin (ID: 1)
- Engineer (ID: 2) 
- Software Tester (ID: 3)
- ProjectLead (ID: 4)
- Developer (ID: 5)
- Tester (ID: 6)
- Stakeholder (ID: 7)
- TeamLead (ID: 8)

**Users Implemented:**
1. **Thando Cibi** - SystemAdmin (uthandocibi@gmail.com)
2. **Dumisani Nxumalo** - TeamLead (dumisaninxumalo5gmail.com) - Team 1
3. **Thabang Ledwaba** - Stakeholder (tledwaba@dynamicdna.co.za)
4. **Paris Ramadwa** - Tester (ramadwaparis@gmail.com) - Team 2
5. **Zilungile Nquku** - Developer (ayakazilungile20@gmail.com) - Team 3

#### 3. **Program.cs Cleanup**
- Removed seeder calls
- Simplified to just ensure database creation

## üîß **Features Implemented**

### **System Admin Capabilities:**
1. **View all active users** (excluding soft-deleted)
2. **Enable/Disable users** via toggle
3. **Delete users** with soft delete (maintains data integrity)
4. **Audit trail** - tracks who deleted which user and when
5. **User details view** showing team and role information

### **Soft Delete Benefits:**
1. **Data Integrity** - Related records remain intact
2. **Audit Trail** - Deletion history is preserved
3. **Reversible** - Users can potentially be restored
4. **Compliance** - Meets data retention requirements

### **Security Features:**
1. **Authorization** - Only System Admin can delete users
2. **Confirmation** - Double confirmation before deletion
3. **Audit Logging** - Tracks deletion activity
4. **CSRF Protection** - All AJAX calls include verification tokens

## üöÄ **Usage Instructions**

### **For System Administrators:**
1. Navigate to the System Admin Dashboard
2. In the "Active Users" section, click the gear icon next to any user
3. Select "Delete User" from the dropdown menu
4. Confirm the deletion in the popup dialog
5. User will be soft-deleted and removed from active user lists

### **Database Schema:**
```sql
-- New columns added to User table
ALTER TABLE [User] ADD 
    IsDeleted BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    DeletedAt DATETIME2 NULL,
    DeletedByUserId INT NULL
```

### **Recovery (if needed):**
To restore a soft-deleted user:
```sql
UPDATE [User] 
SET IsDeleted = 0, DeletedAt = NULL, DeletedByUserId = NULL 
WHERE UserId = [USER_ID]
```

## üìä **Current Database State**

After implementation, the database will contain:
- 5 active users with proper roles and team assignments
- Clean role structure with 8 defined roles
- All users have `IsDeleted = false` by default
- System Admin (Thando) can manage all other users

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

1. **Backup recommended** before running migrations
2. **Soft delete is permanent** from UI perspective (requires manual SQL to restore)
3. **Only System Admins** can delete users
4. **Team assignments** may need adjustment based on business needs
5. **Passwords** are set to default values and should be changed on first login

## üîÑ **Next Steps**

1. Run `dotnet ef database update` to apply the migration
2. Test user deletion functionality
3. Verify dashboard shows correct user counts
4. Test user role assignments and team memberships
5. Consider implementing user restoration feature if needed
